# SOC Engineering Projects

Welcome to the **SOC Engineering Portfolio**! This repository contains hands-on projects designed to simulate real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) environments and workflows.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Diagrams
For a visual overview of all projects, see the **[Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## 📂 Projects

### [Project 1: SOC Lab Environment](project_1/)
A network simulation project using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
- **Focus:** L1-L3 Networking, Firewalls (ASA), VPNs, WireShark Analysis.
- **Goal:** Build a secure enterprise network from scratch and defend it.

### [Project 2: Linux Server Administration & Security](project_2/README.md)
**"The All-Rounder Project"**
- **Focus:** Linux (Ubuntu), Nginx, Security Hardening, Automation (Bash/Ansible), Monitoring.
- **Goal:** Build a secure, monitored, and automated server environment.
- **Roles:** IT Support, SysAdmin, DevOps.

### [Project 3: SOC Platform (Kubernetes)](docs/phase1-infrastructure-setup.md)
A production-grade SOC implementation using **Kubernetes**.
- **Focus:** Infrastructure as Code (K8s), Log Ingestion (Wazuh), Thread Detection, Incident Response (TheHive).
- **Goal:** Deploy a scalable, self-healing SOC platform and process real security events.
