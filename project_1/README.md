# Project 1: SOC Lab Environment (Network Simulation)

This project focuses on building a **Simulated Enterprise Network** using Cisco Packet Tracer to practice fundamental networking and security skills.

## 📂 Documentation

- **[Lab Setup Guide](docs/phase1-lab-setup.md):** Detailed instructions on building the lab.
- **[Packet Tracer Guide](docs/packet_tracer_setup_guide.md):** Steps to replicate the environment in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **[Architecture Overview](../ARCHITECTURE.md#1-project-1-soc-lab-environment):** Network topology and component descriptions.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Build a 3-Tier Network (Core, Access, DMZ).
2. Configure VLANs, Trunks, and STP.
3. Implement Firewall Rules (ASA) and ACLs.
4. Set up Remote Access VPNs.
5. Simulate and analyze traffic (Wireshark).
